AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN ART
44
The tradition of rock-cut caves continued in the Deccan
and they are found not only in Maharashtra but also in
Karnataka, mainly at Badami and Aiholi, executed under
the patronage of the Chalukyas; in Andhra Pradesh in the
area of Vijayawada; and in Tamil Nadu, mainly at
Mahabalipuram, under the patronage of the Pallavas. The
post-sixth-century development of art history in the country
depended more on political patronage than the collective
public patronage of the early historic periods.
Mention may also be made of the terracotta figurines
that are found at many places all over the country. They
show a parallel tradition with the religious lithic sculptures
as well as the independent local tradition. Many terracotta
figures of various sizes are found which show their
popularity. They are toys, religious figurines as well as
figurines made for healing purposes as part of the belief
systems.
Cave Tradition in Eastern India
Like in western India, Buddhist caves have also been
excavated in eastern India, mainly in the coastal region of
Andhra Pradesh, and in Odisha. One of the main sites in
Andhra Pradesh is Guntapalle in Eluru district. The caves
have been excavated in the hills along with the structured
monasteries. Perhaps it is among the very unique sites
where the structured stupas, viharas and the caves are
excavated at one place. The Guntapalle chaitya cave is
circular with a stupa in the circular hall and a chaitya
arch carved at the entrance. The cave is relatively small
when compared to the caves in western India. A number
of vihara caves have been excavated. The main vihara caves,
despite the small dimensions, have been decorated with
