Fort. The everyday use of the minar was for the
azaan or call to prayer. Its phenomenal height,
however, symbolised the might and power of the
ruler. The Qutub Minar also came to be associated
with the much revered saint of Delhi, Khwaja
Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki.
The Qutub Minar, built in the thirteenth
century, is a 234-feet-high tapering tower divided
into five storeys. The minar is a mix of polygonal
and circular shapes. It is largely built of red and
buff sandstone with some use of marble in the
upper storeys. It is characterised by highly
decorated balconies and bands of inscriptions
intertwined with foliated designs.
Chand Minar, built in the fifteenth century,
is a 210- feet-high tapering tower divided into
four storeys. Painted peach now, its fa√ßade once
boasted of chevron patterning on the encaustic
tile work and bold bands of Quranic verses.
Although it looked like an Iranian monument, it
was the combined handiwork of local architects with those from
Delhi and Iran.

Rahim Khan-i-Khanan, Akbar and Itmaduddaula. According to
Anthony Welch, the idea behind the tomb was eternal paradise
as a reward for the true believer on the Day of Judgement. This
led to the paradisiacal imagery for tomb construction. Beginning
