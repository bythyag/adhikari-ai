SOME ASPECTS OF INDO-ISLAMIC ARCHITECTURE

with the introduction of Quranic verses on the walls, the tomb
was subsequently placed within paradisiacal elements such as a
garden or near a body of water or both, as is in the case of the Taj
Mahal. Surely though, such vast expanses of structured and
stylised spaces could not have been intended only to signify peace
and happiness in the next world but to also showcase the majesty,
grandeur and might of the person buried there.
SARAIS
A hugely interesting feature of medieval India was the sarais which
ringed cities and dotted the vast space of the Indian sub-
continent. Sarais were largely built on a simple square or
rectangular plan and were meant to provide temporary
accommodation to Indian and foreign travellers, pilgrims,
merchants, traders, etc. In effect, sarais were public domains
which thronged with people of varied cultural backgrounds.  This
led to cross-cultural interaction, influences and syncretic
tendencies in the cultural mores of the times and at the level of
the people.
STRUCTURES FOR COMMON PEOPLE
One of the architectural features of medieval India was also a
coming together of styles, techniques and decorations in public
and private spaces of non-royal sections of the society. These
included buildings for domestic usage, temples, mosques,
khanqahs and dargahs, commemorative gateways, pavilions in
buildings and gardens, bazaars, etc.
