AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN ART

the walls. The back wall has the main Buddha shrine.
Shrine images at Ajanta are grand in size. Some of the
vihara caves are unfinished such as Cave Nos. 5, 14, 23
24, 28 and 29. Among the important patrons at Ajanta
were Varahadeva (patron of Cave No. 16), the prime minister
of the Vakataka king, Harishena; Upendragupta (patron of
Cave Nos. 17â€“20) the local king of the region and
feudatory of the Vakataka king, Harishena;
Buddhabhadra (patron of Cave No. 26); and
Mathuradasa (patron of Cave No. 4). Many
paintings have survived in Cave Nos. 1, 2, 16
and 17.
Paintings have a lot of typological variations.
Outward projections are used in the Ajanta
paintings of the fifth century CE. Lines are clearly
defined and are very rhythmic. Body colour gets
merged with the outer line creating the effect of
volume. The figures are heavy like the sculptures
of western India.
The caves of the early phase also have paintings
especially Cave Nos. 9 and 10. Paintings in Cave
No. 10 are an afterthought as is evident from the
plastering over the early inscriptions inside the
cave. On the other hand the paintings in Cave No.
9 are part of the preplanning. They belong to the
first century BCE. The figures are broad with heavy
proportion and arranged in the picture space in a
linear way. Lines are sharp. Colours are limited.
