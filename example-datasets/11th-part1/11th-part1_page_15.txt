PREHISTORIC ROCK
PAINTINGS
T 
HE distant past when there was no paper or language
or the written word, and hence no books or written
documents, is called prehistory, or, as we often say,
prehistoric times. How people lived in those times was
difficult to surmise until scholars began to discover the
places where prehistoric people lived. Excavation at these
places brought to light old tools, pottery, habitats, bones
of ancient human beings and animals, and drawings on
cave walls. By piecing together the information deduced
from these objects and the cave drawings, scholars have
constructed fairly accurate knowledge about what
happened and how people lived in prehistoric times. When
the basic needs of food, water, clothing and shelter were
fulfilled people felt the need to express themselves. Painting
and drawing were the oldest art forms practised by human
beings to express themselves, using the cave walls as their
canvas.
Why did prehistoric people draw these pictures? They
may have drawn and painted to make their homes more
colourful and beautiful or to keep a visual record of  their
day-to-day life, like some of us who maintain a diary.
The prehistoric period in the early development of
human beings is commonly known as the Old Stone
Age or the Palaeolithic Age.
Prehistoric paintings have been found in many parts of
the world. We do not really know if Lower Palaeolithic people
ever produced any art objects. But by the Upper Palaeolithic
times we see a proliferation of artistic activities. Around
the world the walls of many caves of this time are full of
finely carved and painted pictures of animals which the
cave-dwellers hunted. The subjects of their drawings were
human figures, human activities, geometric designs and
symbols. In India the earliest paintings have been reported
from the Upper Palaeolithic times.
