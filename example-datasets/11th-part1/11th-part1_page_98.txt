Pulakesin II of Karnataka. Narasimhavarman I, also known
as Mamalla, who acceded the Pallava throne around 640
CE, is celebrated for the expansion of the empire, avenging
the defeat his father had suffered at the hands of Pulakesin
II, and inaugurating most of the building works at
Mahabalipuram which is known after him as
Mamallapuram.
The shore temple at Mahabalipuram was built later,
probably in the reign of Narasimhavarman II, also known
as Rajasimha who reigned from 700 to 728 CE. Now it is
oriented to the east facing the ocean, but if you study it
closely, you will find that it actually houses three shrines,
two to Shiva, one facing east and the other west, and a
middle one to Vishnu who is shown as Anantashayana.
This is unusual, because temples generally have a single
main shrine and not three areas of worship. This shows
that it was probably not originally conceived like this and
different shrines may have been added at different times,
modified perhaps with the change of patrons. In the
compound there is evidence of a water tank, an early
example of a gopuram, and several other images.
Sculptures of the bull, Nandi, Shiva’s mount, line the
temple walls, and these, along with the carvings on the
temple’s lower walls have suffered severe disfiguration due
to erosion by salt-water laden air over the centuries.
The magnificent Shiva temple of Thanjavur, called the
Rajarajeswara or Brihadiswara temple, was completed
around 1009 by Rajaraja Chola, and is the largest and
tallest of all Indian temples. Temple building was prolific
at this time, and over a hundred important temples of the
Brihadiswara temple, Thanjavur
