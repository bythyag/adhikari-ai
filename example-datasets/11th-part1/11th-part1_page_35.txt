ARTS OF THE MAURYAN PERIOD
21
Due to the popularity of Buddhism and Jainism, stupas
and viharas were constructed on a large scale. However,
there are also examples of a few Brahmanical gods in the
sculptural representations. It is important to note that the
stupas were constructed over the relics of the Buddha at
Rajagraha, Vaishali, Kapilavastu, Allakappa, Ramagrama,
Vethadipa, Pava, Kushinagar and Pippalvina. The textual
tradition also mentions construction of various other stupas
on the relics of the Buddha at several places including
Avanti and Gandhara which are outside the Gangetic valley.
Stupa, vihara and chaitya are part of Buddhist and Jaina
monastic complexes but the largest number belongs to the
Buddhist religion. One of the best examples of the structure
of a stupa in the third century BCE is at Bairat in
Rajasthan. It is a very grand stupa having a circular mound
with a circumambulatory path. The great stupa at Sanchi
(which will be discussed later) was built with bricks during
the time of Ashoka and later it was covered with stone and
many new additions were made.
Subsequently many such stupas were constructed which
shows the popularity of Buddhism. From the second
century BCE onwards, we get many inscriptional evidences
mentioning donors and, at times, their profession. The
pattern of patronage has been a very collective one and
there are very few examples of royal patronage. Patrons
range from lay devotees to gahapatis and kings. Donations
by the guilds are also mentioned at several sites. However,
there are very few inscriptions mentioning the names of
artisans such as Kanha at Pitalkhora and his disciple
Balaka at Kondane caves. Artisansâ€™ categories like stone
carvers, goldsmiths, stone-polishers, carpenters, etc. are
also mentioned in the inscriptions. The method of working
