in villages and forest areas, but again, not being of stone
the ancient or medieval shrines in those areas have also

to the temple which may be a portico or colonnaded hall
that incorporates space for a large number of worshippers
and is known as a mandapa; (iii) from the fifth century CE
onwards, freestanding temples tend to have a mountain-

in North India and a pyramidal tower, called a vimana, in
South India; (iv) the vahan, i.e., the mount or vehicle of
the temple’s main deity along with a standard pillar or
dhvaj is placed axially before the sanctum. Two broad orders
of temples in the country are known— Nagara in the north
and Dravida in the south. At times, the Vesar style of
temples as an independent style created through the selective
