ARTS OF THE INDUS VALLEY

MOTHER GODDESS
The mother goddess figures are usually crude standing female
figures adorned with necklaces hanging over prominent breasts
and wearing a loin cloth and a girdle. The fan-shaped head-dress
with a cup-like projection on each side is a distinct decorative
feature of the mother goddess figures of the Indus Valley. The
pellet eyes and beaked nose of the figures are very crude, and the
mouth is indicated by a slit.
MALE TORSO
In this red sandstone figure, there are socket holes in the neck
and shoulders for the attachment of head and arms. The frontal
posture of the torso has been consciously adopted. The
shoulders are well baked and the abdomen slightly prominent.
PAINTED EARTHEN JAR
Found in Mohenjodaro, this jar is made on a
potterâ€™s wheel with clay. The shape was
manipulated by the pressure of the crafty
fingers of the potter. After baking the clay
model, it was painted with black colour. High
polishing was done as a finishing touch. The
motifs are of vegetals and geometric forms.
Designs are simple but with a tendency
towards abstraction.
