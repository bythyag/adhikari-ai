The theme of Ravana shaking Mount Kailasha
has been  depicted several times in the caves of
Ellora. But the most noteworthy of all is the one
depicted on the left wall of Kailashnath temple
(Cave No.16) at Ellora. The image is dated to the
eighth century CE. It is a colossal sculpture and
is considered as one of the masterpieces of Indian
sculpture. It depicts the episode of Ravana
shaking Mount Kailasha when Lord Shiva along
with Parvati and others were on the mountain.
The composition is divided into several tiers. The
lower tier depicts Ravana, multi-faced and multi-
armed shaking the mount with ease. The depth
of carvings of the multiple hands brings out the
effect of three-dimensional space. Ravanaâ€™s body
is angular pushing one leg inside. The hands are
expanded on the sides of the inside chamber
created by the image of Ravana. The upper half
is divided into three frames. The centre occupied
by the image of Shiva and Parvati. Parvati is
shown moving close to Shiva scared by the
commotion on the hill. Her stretched legs and
slightly twisted body in the recessed space create
a very dramatic effect of light and shade. The
volume of sculpture is very pronounced; the
attendant fiures are equally  voluminous. The
gana (dwarf) figures are shown in action, involved
in their activities. The celestial beings above
Shiva and Parvati witnessing the event are
shown in frozen movement. Protrusion of volume
and recession in the space are important
landmarks in the images of the Ellora caves.
Light and darkness has been exploited by
creating the images in full round. Their torsos
are slender with heaviness in its surface
treatment, arms are slim in full round. Attendant
figures on the two sides have angular frontality.
Every image in the composition is beautifully
interwoven structurally with each other.
