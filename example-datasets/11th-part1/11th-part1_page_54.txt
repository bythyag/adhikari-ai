painting were simultaneous processes and dating of the
paintings follows the date of the cave excavations. The
next stage of development is observed mainly in the
paintings of Cave Nos. 16, 17, 1, and 2. However, it does

Infact almost in all the finished excavations, pictures have

Lines are forceful and full of energy. Attempts are also
made to give highlights in the figural compositions.
The paintings of Cave Nos. 1 and 2 are very orderly and
