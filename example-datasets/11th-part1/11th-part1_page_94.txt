AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN ART

On the southern wall is a massive sculpture of surya carved
out of green stone. It is said that there were three such
images, each carved out of a different stone placed on the
three temple walls, each facing different directions. The
fourth wall had the doorway into the temple from where
the actual rays of the sun would enter the garbhagriha.
The Hills
A unique form of architecture developed in the hills of
Kumaon, Garhwal, Himachal and Kashmir. Kashmirâ€™s
proximity to prominent Gandhara sites (such as Taxila,
Peshawar and the northwest frontier) lent the region a
strong Gandhara influence by the fifth century CE. This
began to mix with the Gupta and post-Gupta traditions
that were brought to it from Sarnath, Mathura and even
centres in Gujarat and Bengal. Brahmin pundits and
Buddhist monks frequently travelled between Kashmir,
Garhwal, Kumaon and religious centres in the plains like
Banaras, Nalanda and even as far south as Kanchipuram.
As a result both Buddhist and Hindu traditions began to
intermingle and spread in the hills. The hills also had
their own tradition of wooden buildings with pitched roofs.
At several places in the hills, therefore, you will find that
while the main garbhagriha and shikhara are made in a
rekha-prasada or latina style, the mandapa is of an older
form of wooden architecture. Sometimes, the temple itself
takes on a pagoda shape.
The Karkota period of Kashmir is the most significant
in terms of architecture. One of the most important temples
is Pandrethan, built during the eighth and ninth centuries.
In keeping with the tradition of a water tank attached to
the shrine, this temple is built on a plinth built in the
Temple, Himachal Pradesh
