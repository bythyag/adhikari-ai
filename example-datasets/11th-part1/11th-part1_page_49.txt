POST-MAURYAN TRENDS IN INDIAN ART AND ARCHITECTURE
35
Construction of a large number of stupas does not mean
that there were no structured temples or viharas or chaityas.
We do get evidences but no structured chaitya or vihara
survived. Among the important structured viharas, mention
may be made of the Sanchi apsidal chaitya structure, i.e.,
temple 18, which is a simple shrine temple having front
pillars and a hall at the back. Similar structured temples
at Guntapalle are also worth mentioning. Along with the
images of the Buddha, other Buddhist images of
Boddhisattvas like Avalokiteshvara, Padmapani, Vajrapani,
Amitabha, and Maitreya Buddha started getting sculpted.
However, with the rise of Vajrayana Buddhism many
Boddhisattva images were added as a part of the personified
representations of certain virtues or qualities as propagated
by the Buddhist religious principles for the welfare of
the masses.
Cave Tradition in Western India
In western India, many Buddhist caves dating back to the
second century BCE onwards have been excavated. Mainly
three architectural types were executedâ€”(i) apsidal vault-
roof chaitya halls (found at Ajanta, Pitalkhora, Bhaja); (ii)
apsidal vault-roof pillarless hall (found at Thana-Nadsur);
and (iii) flat-roofed quadrangular hall with a circular
chamber at the back (found at Kondivite). The front of the
chaitya hall is dominated by the motif of a semi-circular
chaitya arch with an open front which has a wooden facade
and, in some cases, there is no dominating chaitya arch
window such as found at Kondivite. In all the chaitya caves
a stupa at the back is common.
In the first century BCE some modifications were made
to the standard plan of the apsidal vault-roof variety where
the hall becomes rectangular like at Ajanta Cave No. 9
