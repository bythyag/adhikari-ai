and a short beard and whiskers; the ears resemble double
shells with a hole in the middle. The hair is parted in the
middle, and a plain woven fillet is passed round the head.
An armlet is worn on the right hand and holes around the

Bronze Casting
The art of bronze-casting was practised on a wide scale by
the Harappans. Their bronze statues were made using the
‘lost wax’ technique in which the wax figures were first
covered with a coating of clay and allowed to dry. Then the
wax was heated and the molten wax was drained out
through a tiny hole made in the clay cover. The hollow
mould thus created was filled with molten metal which
took the original shape of the object. Once the metal cooled,
the clay cover was completely removed. In bronze we find
human as well as animal figures, the best example of the
former being the statue of a girl popularly titled ‘Dancing
Girl’. Amongst animal figures in bronze the buffalo with
its uplifted head, back and sweeping horns and the goat
are of artistic merit. Bronze casting was popular at all the
major centres of the Indus Valley Civilisation. The copper
dog and bird of Lothal and the bronze figure of a bull from
Kalibangan are in no way inferior to the human figures of
copper and bronze from Harappa and Mohenjodaro. Metal-
casting appears to be a continuous tradition. The late
Harappan and Chalcolithic sites like Daimabad in
Maharashtra yielded excellent examples of metal-cast
