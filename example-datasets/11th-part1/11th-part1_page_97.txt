TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE
83
vaulted shapes of apsidal chaityas with a horse-shoe shaped
entrance facade usually called a nasi; circular or vritta;
and octagonal or ashtasra. Generally speaking, the plan of
the temple and the shape of the vimana were conditioned
by the iconographic nature of the consecrated deity, so it
was appropriate to build specific types of temples for specific
types of icons. It must, however, be remembered that this
is a simplistic differentiation of the subdivisions. Several
different shapes may be combined in specific periods and
places to create their own unique style.
The Pallavas were one of the ancient South Indian
dynasties that were active in the Andhra region from the
second century CE onwards and moved south to settle in
Tamil Nadu. Their history is better documented from the
sixth to the eighth century, when they left many
inscriptions in stone and several monuments. Their
powerful kings spread their empire to various parts of the
subcontinent, at times reaching the borders of Odisha,
and their links with Southâ€“East Asia were also strong.
Although they were mostly Shaivite, several Vaishnava
shrines also survived from their reign, and there is no
doubt that they were influenced by the long Buddhist
history of the Deccan.
Their early buildings, it is generally assumed, were rock-
cut, while the later ones were structural. However, there
is reason to believe that structural buildings were well
known even when rock-cut ones were being excavated. The
early buildings are generally attributed to the reign of
Mahendravarman I, a contemporary of the Chalukyan king,
