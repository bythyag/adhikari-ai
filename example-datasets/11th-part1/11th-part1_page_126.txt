MATERIALS FOR CONSTRUCTION
The walls in all buildings were extremely thick and were largely
constructed of rubble masonary, which was easily available. These
walls were then cased over with chunam or limestone plaster or
dressed stone. An amazing range of stones were utilised for
construction such as quartzite, sandstone, buff, marble, etc.
Polychrome tiles were used to great advantage to finish the walls.
From the beginning of the seventeenth century, bricks were also
used for construction and these imparted greater flexibility to
the structures. In this phase there was more reliance on local
materials.
FORTS
Building monumental forts with embattlements was a regular
feature in medieval times, often symbolising the seat of power of
a king. When such a fort was captured by an attacking army the
vanquished ruler either lost his complete power or his sovereignty.
This was because he had to accept the suzerainty of the victorious
king. Some examples of strong, complex edifices which still
exercise the imagination of the visitor are the forts of Chittor,
Gwalior, Daulatabad, earlier known as Devgiri and Golconda.
Commanding heights were utilised to great advantage to
construct forts. These heights gave a good perspective of the
region, strategic advantage for security, unfettered and
unhindered space to make residential and official complexes while
simultaneously creating a sense of awe in the people. Other
complexities woven into such topography were concentric circles
