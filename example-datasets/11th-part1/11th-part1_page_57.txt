POST-MAURYAN TRENDS IN INDIAN ART AND ARCHITECTURE
43
forms according to Puranic narrative are depicted. Among
the Shaivite themes, Ravana shaking Mount Kailash,
Andhakasurvadha, Kalyanasundara are profusely depicted
whereas among the Vaishnavite themes, the different
avatars of Vishnu are depicted. The sculptures at Ellora
are monumental, and have protruding volume that create
deep recession in the picture space. The images are heavy
and show considerable sophistication in the handling of
sculptural volume. Various guilds at Ellora came from
different places like Vidarbha, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
and carved the sculptures. Thereby it is the most diverse
site in India in terms of the sculptural styles. Cave No. 16
is known as Kailash leni. A rock-cut temple has been carved
out of a single rock, a unique achievement of the artisans,
which will be discussed in the next chapter. Among the
important Shaivite caves are Cave No. 29 and Cave No. 21.
The plan of Cave No. 29 is almost like that of the main cave
at Elephanta. The sculptural quality of Cave Nos. 29, 21,
17, 14 and 16 is amazing for its monumentality and vigorous
movements in the picture space.
Elephanta Caves and Other Sites
The Elephanta Caves located near Mumbai, were originally
a Buddhist site which was later dominated by the Shaivite
faith. It is contemporary with Ellora, and its sculptures
show slenderness in the body, with stark light and dark
effects. The other noteworthy cave site is Bagh located
near Indore in Madhya Pradesh.
