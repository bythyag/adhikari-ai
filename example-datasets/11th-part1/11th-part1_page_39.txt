The life-size standing image of a Yakshini holding a chauri (flywhisk)
from Didargunj near modern Patna is another good example of the
sculptural tradition of the Mauryan Period. Kept in Patna Museum,
it is a tall, well-proportioned, free-standing sculpture in round made
in sandstone with a polished surface. The chauri is held in the right
hand whereas the left hand is broken. The image shows
sophistication in the treatment of form and medium. The sculptorâ€™s
sensitivity towards the round muscular body is clearly visible. The
face has round, fleshy cheeks, while the neck is relatively small in
proportion; the eyes, nose and lips are sharp. Folds of muscles are
properly rendered. The necklace beads are in full round, hanging to
the belly. The tightening of garment around the belly creates the
effect of a bulging belly. The lower garment has been rendered with
great care. Every fold of the garment on the legs is shown by
protruding lines clinging to the legs, which also create a somewhat
transparent effect. The middle band of the garment falls till the feet.
Thick bell-ornaments adorn the feet. The image stands firmly on its
legs. Heaviness in the torso is depicted by heavy breasts. The back
is equally impressive. The hair is tied in a knot at the back. The
back is bare. Drapery at the back covers both legs. The flywhisk in
the right hand is shown with incised lines continued on the back of
the image.
