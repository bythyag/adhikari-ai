POST-MAURYAN TRENDS IN INDIAN ART AND ARCHITECTURE

Figures in these caves are painted
with considerable naturalism and
there is no over -stylisation.
Events are grouped together
according 
to 
geographical
location. Tiered, horizontally-
arranged figures appear as a
convenient choice of the artisans.
Separation of geographic location
has been indicated by using
outward architectural bands.
Figures appear like the Sanchi
sculptures which indicate how
the lithic and painting traditions
were progressing simultaneously.
The frontal knot of the headgear of the figures follows the
same pattern as that of the sculptures. However, there
are a few different patterns of headgear.
The second phase of paintings can be studied from the
images of the Buddhas painted on the walls and pillars of
Cave Nos. 10 and 9. These Buddha figures are different
from the figures painted in the fifth century CE. Such
developments in paintings need to be understood in the
context of the religious requirement. Cave excavation and
