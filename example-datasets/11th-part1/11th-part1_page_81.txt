Krishna playing flute, 
accompanied by  Gopikas, 
Krishna temple, 
Pundareekapuram 
figures in three-dimensionality. Most of the 
paintings are seen on the walls of shrines 
and cloister walls of temples and some inside 
palaces. Thematically too, paintings from 
Kerala stand apart. Most of the narrations 
are based on those episodes from Hindu 
mythology which were popular in Kerala. The 
artist seems to have derived sources from 
oral traditions and local versions of the 
Ramayana and the Mahabharata for painted 
narration. 
More than sixty sites have been found 
with mural paintings which include three 
palaces—Dutch 
palace 
in 
Kochi, 
Krishnapuram palace in Kayamkulam and 
Padmanabhapuram palace. Among the sites 
where one can see the mature phase of 
Kerala’s mural painting tradition are 
Pundareekapuram Krishna temple, 
Panayanarkavu, Thirukodithanam, Triprayar 
Sri 
Rama 
temple 
and 
Trissur 
Vadakkunathan temple. 
Even today we observe that mural 
painting on interior and exterior walls of 
houses in villages or havelis is prevalent in 
different parts of the country. These paintings are usually 
made by women either at the time of ceremonies or festivals 
or as a routine to clean and decorate the walls. Some of 
the traditional forms of murals are pithoro in parts of 
Rajasthan and Gujarat, Mithila painting in northern 
Bihar’s Mithila region, warli paintings in Maharashtra, or 
simply paintings on the walls, be it in a village of Odisha 
or Bengal, Madhya Pradesh or Chhattisgarh.
