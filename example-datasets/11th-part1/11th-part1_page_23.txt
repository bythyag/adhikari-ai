HE arts of the Indus Valley Civilisation emerged during
the second half of the third millennium BCE. The forms
of art found from various sites of the civilisation include
sculptures, seals, pottery, gold jewellery, terracotta figures,
etc. The artists of that time surely had fine artistic
sensibilities and a vivid imagination. Their delineation of
human and animal figures was highly realistic in nature,
since the anatomical details included in them was unique,
and, in the case of terracotta art, the modelling of animal
figures was done in an extremely careful manner.
The two major sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation,
along the Indus river—the cities of Harappa in the north
and Mohenjodaro in the south—showcase one of earliest
examples of civic planning. Other markers were houses,
markets, storage facilities, offices, public baths, etc.,
arranged in a grid-like pattern. There was also a highly
developed drainage system. While  Harappa and
Mohenjodaro are situated in Pakistan, the important sites
excavated in India are Lothal and Dholavira in Gujarat,
Rakhigarhi in Haryana, Ropar in the Punjab,
Kalibangan and Balathal in Rajasthan, etc.
Statues whether in stone, bronze or terracotta
found in Harappan sites are not abundant, but refined.
Stone Statues
The stone statuaries found at Harappa and
Mohenjodaro are excellent examples of handling three-
dimensional volumes. In stone are two male figures—
one is a torso in red sandstone and the other is a
bust of a bearded man in steatite—which are
extensively discussed.
The figure of the bearded man interpreted as a
priest, is draped in a shawl coming under the right
arm and covering the left shoulder. This shawl is
decorated with trefoil patterns. The eyes are a little
elongated, and half-closed as in meditative
concentration. The nose is well formed and of medium
