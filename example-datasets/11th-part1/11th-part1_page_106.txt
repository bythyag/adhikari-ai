and Sri Lanka, Thailand, Burma and various other
countries from the south-eastern parts of Asia. Monks and
pilgrims would take back small sculptures and illustrated
manuscripts from here to their own countries. Buddhist
monasteries like Nalanda, thus, were prolific centres of
art production that had a decisive impact on the arts of
all Buddhist countries in Asia.
The sculptural art of Nalanda, in stucco, stone and
bronze, developed out of a heavy dependence on the
Buddhist Gupta art of Sarnath. By the ninth century a
synthesis occurred between the Sarnath Gupta idiom, the
local Bihar tradition, and that of central India, leading to
the formation of the Nalanda school of sculpture
characterised by distinctive facial features, body forms and
treatment of clothing and jewellery. The characteristic
features of Nalanda art, distinguished by its consistently
high quality of workmanship, are that the precisely
executed sculptures have an ordered appearance with little
effect of crowding. Sculptures are also usually not flat in
relief but are depicted in three-dimensional forms. The
back slabs of the sculptures are detailed and the
ornamentations delicate. The Nalanda bronzes, dating
between the seventh and eighth centuries to approximately
the twelfth century outnumber the discovery of metal
images from all other sites of eastern India and constitute
a large body of Pala Period metal sculptures. Like their
stone counterparts, the bronzes initially relied heavily on
Sarnath and Mathura Gupta traditions. The Nalanda
sculptures initially depict Buddhist deities of the Mahayana
