on in various parts of the country, Buddhist, Jain and
Hindu sculptural and architectural developments. During
the Indo-Islamic period and before the Mughal rule,
another era dawned upon India, which saw massive
constructions in the form of forts and palaces. Different
aspects of all these styles have been discussed to introduce
students with the fabric of Indiaâ€™s culture.
The NCERT appreciates the hard work done by the
Textbook Development Committee responsible for making
this book. We wish to thank the Chief Advisor for this
textbook, Professor Ratan Parimoo, Retired Head,
Department of Art History and Dean, Faculty of Fine Arts,
M. S. University of Baroda, for guiding the work of this
committee. It was a challenge for other art historians
involved in making of this textbook for students at the
school level and their efforts are praiseworthy. We are
indebted to the institutions and organisations which have
generously permitted us to draw upon their resource
materials and personnel. We are especially grateful to the
members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed
by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education,
Ministry of Human Resource Development under the
Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor
G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution.
As an organisation committed to the systemic reform and
continuous improvement in the quality of its products,
NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will
enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.
