JAMA MASJID
Large mosques spanning huge
spaces also dotted the landscape of
the Indian sub-continent in medieval
times. Congregational prayers were
held here every Friday afternoon
which required the presence of a
minimum of forty Muslim male
adults. At the time of prayers a
Khutba was read out in the name of
the ruler and his laws for the realm
were also read out. In medieval times
a city had one Jama Masjid which,
along 
with 
its 
immediate
surroundings became the focus of
the lives of the people, both Muslim and non-Muslim. This
happened because a lot of commercial and cultural exchanges
were concentrated here besides religious and indirect political
activity. Generally such a mosque was large with an open
courtyard, surrounded on three sides by cloisters and the Qibla
Liwan in the west. It was here that the mihrab and the mimbar for
the Imam were located. People faced the mihrab while offering
prayers as it indicated the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca.
