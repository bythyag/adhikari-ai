working situation. A guild of artisans may have been
employed by the religious and political authorities for
making monuments and accordingly the artisans had to
work and devise their execution techniques along with
necessary innovations, etc. In this textbook only an
introductory outline has been attempted from pre- and
proto-historic times till the times of the Islamic monuments
during the late medieval period.
Considering the level of the young generation readers
belonging to the higher secondary stage, the present book
outlines just a few examples to create an understanding of
the nature of developments in Indian art. It is not intended
to discard such examples which we know are important
but all the contributors have made a conscious attempt to
present convincing holistic pictures. The chapters in the
book provide an outline of different forms of arts from most
of the regions of the country.
Human civilisation begins with the emergence of the
human being on the earth. In this book a simpler but at
the same time a distinct vocabulary has been introduced.
The idea is not only to present the vast amount of data
available but also to generate interest in understanding
the visual traditions of Indian art. For any student of fine
arts it is necessary to be aware of the visual tradition in
the past as to understand present art production.
Understanding of visual tradition enriches visual
understanding. Hope the young minds find the book
enriching as is intended.
