TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE

shikhara, later temples had several. The garbhagriha is
always located directly under the tallest tower.
There are many subdivisions of nagara temples
depending on the shape of the shikhara. There are different
names for the various parts of the temple in different parts
of India; however, the most common name for the simple
shikhara which is square at the base and whose walls
curve or slope inward to a point on top is called the 'latina'
or the rekha-prasada type of shikara.
The second major type of architectural form in the nagara
order is the phamsana. Phamsana buildings tend to be
broader and shorter than latina ones. Their roofs are
composed of several slabs that gently rise to a single point
over the centre of the building, unlike the latina ones which
look like sharply rising tall towers. Phamsana roofs do not
curve inward, instead they slope upwards on a straight
incline. In many North Indian temples you will notice that
the phamsana design is used for the mandapas while the
main garbhagriha is housed in a latina building. Later on,
the latina buildings grew complex, and instead of appearing
like a single tall tower, the temple began to support many
smaller towers, which were clustered together like rising
mountain-peaks with the tallest one being in the centre,
and this was the one which was always above the
garbhagriha.
The third main sub-type of the nagara building is what
is generally called the valabhi type. These are rectangular
buildings with a roof that rises into a vaulted chamber.
