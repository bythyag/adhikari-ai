AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN ART

absolute attention has been paid to the clarity of form
despite its size and role in the narrative. Narratives are
profusely depicted which include events from the life of
the Buddha and the Jataka stories. There are a number of
Jataka scenes that have not been completely identified. In
the depiction of the birth event, the queen is shown
reclining on a bed surrounded by female attendants and a
small-sized elephant is carved on the upper frame of the
composition showing the dream of Queen Mayadevi. In
another relief, four events related to the birth of the Buddha
are shown. These represent varied ways of depicting the
narratives.
The animated movement in the figures gets reduced in
the sculptures of Nagarjunkonda and Goli in the third
century CE. Even within the relatively low relief volume
than 
in 
the 
Amaravati 
sculptures, 
artists 
at
Nagarjunkonda and Goli managed to create the effect of
protruding surfaces of the body which is suggestive in
nature and look very integral. Independent Buddha images
are also found at Amaravati, Nagarjunkonda and
Guntapalle. Guntapalle is a rock-cut cave site near Eluru.
Small apsidal and circular chaitya halls have been
excavated belonging to the second century BCE. The other
important site where rock-cut stupas have been excavated
is Anakapalle near Vishakhapatanam. In Karnataka,
Sannati is the largest stupa site excavated so far. It also
has a stupa like the one in Amaravati decorated with
sculptural relief.
