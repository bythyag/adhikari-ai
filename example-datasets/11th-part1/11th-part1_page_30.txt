BULL
This bronze figure of a bull from
Mohenjodaro deserves mention. The
massiveness of the bull and the fury
of the charge are eloquently
expressed. The animal is shown
standing with his head turned to the
right and with a cord around the
neck.
DANCING GIRL
One of the best known artefacts from the Indus Valley
is this approximately four-inch-high copper figure
of a dancing girl. Found in Mohenjodaro, this
exquisite casting depicts a girl whose long hair is
tied in a bun. Bangles cover her left arm, a bracelet
and an amulet or bangle adorn her right arm, and
a cowry shell necklace is seen around her neck.
Her right hand is on her hip and her left hand is
clasped in a traditional Indian dance gesture. She
has large eyes and flat nose. This figure is full of
expression and bodily vigour and conveys a lot of
information.
