of both the Gupta and the Vakataka period
bronzes. Chakreshvari is the Shasanadevi of
Adinath and Ambika is of Neminath.
Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir regions also
produced bronze images of Buddhist deities as well
as Hindu gods and goddesses. Most of these were
created during the eighth, ninth and tenth
centuries and have a very distinct style in
comparison with bronzes from other parts of India.
A noteworthy development is the growth of different
types of iconography of Vishnu images. Four-headed
Vishnu, also known as  Chaturanana or Vaikuntha
Vishnu, was worshipped in these regions. While
the central face represents Vasudeva, the other two
faces are that of Narasimha and Varaha. The
Narasimha avatar and Mahishasuramardini Durga
images of Himachal Pradesh are among the very
dynamic bronzes from that region.
In Buddhist centres like Nalanda, a school of
bronze-casting emerged around the ninth century
during the rule of the Pala Dynasty in Bihar and
Bengal regions. In the gap of a few centuries the sculptors
at Kurkihar near Nalanda were able to revive the classical
style of the Gupta period. A remarkable bronze is of a four-
