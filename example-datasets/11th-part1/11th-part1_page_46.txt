Early Temples
While construction of stupas continued, Brahmanical
temples and images of gods also started getting
constructed. Often temples were decorated with the images
of gods. Myths mentioned in the Puranas became part of
narrative representation of the Brahmanical religion. Each
temple had a principal image of a god. The shrines of the
temples were of three kindsâ€”(i) sandhara type (without
pradikshinapatha), 
(ii) 
nirandhara 
type 
(with
pradakshinapatha), and (iii) sarvatobhadra (which can be
accessed from all sides). Some of the important temple
sites of this period are Deogarh in Uttar Pradesh, Eran,
Nachna-Kuthara and Udaygiri near Vidisha in Madhya
Pradesh. These temples are simple structures consisting
of a veranda, a hall and a shrine at the rear. They will be
discussed in detail in the next chapter.
Among the important stupa sites outside the Gangetic
valley is Devnimori in Gujarat. In the subsequent centuries
sculptures had little variations while slender images with
transparent drapery remained a dominant aesthetic
sensibility.
