adopted in Mughal buildings, and is known across North
India as the Bangla roof. In the Mughal period and later,
scores of terracotta brick temples were built across Bengal
and Bangladesh in a unique style that had elements of

combined with older forms reminiscent of the Pala period
and with the forms of arches and domes that were taken
from Islamic architecture. These can be widely found in and
around Vishnupur, Bankura, Burdwan and Birbhum and
are dated mostly to the seventeenth century.

Bhubaneswar or ancient Tribhuvanesvara, Puri and
Konark. The temples of Odisha constitute a distinct sub-
style within the nagara order. In general, here the shikhara,
called deul in Odisha, is vertical almost until the top when
it suddenly curves sharply inwards. Deuls are preceded,
