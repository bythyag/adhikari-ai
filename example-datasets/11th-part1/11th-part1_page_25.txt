ARTS OF THE INDUS VALLEY

sculptures. They mainly consist of human and animal
figures. It shows how the tradition of figure sculpture
continued down the ages.
Terracotta
The Indus Valley people made terracotta images also  but
compared to the stone and bronze statues the terracotta
representations of human form are crude in the Indus
Valley. They are more realistic in Gujarat sites and
Kalibangan. The most important among the Indus figures
are those representing the mother goddess. In terracotta,
we also find a few figurines of bearded males with coiled

this figure in exactly the same position would suggest that
he was a deity. A terracotta mask of a horned deity has
also been found. Toy carts with wheels, whistles, rattles,
birds and animals, gamesmen and discs were also rendered
in terracotta.

made of steatite, and occasionally of agate, chert, copper,
faience and terracotta, with beautiful figures of animals,
such as unicorn bull, rhinoceros, tiger, elephant, bison,
goat, buffalo, etc. The realistic rendering of these animals
in various moods is remarkable. The purpose of producing
seals was mainly commercial. It appears that the seals
were also used as amulets, carried on the persons of their
owners, perhaps as modern-day identity cards. The
standard Harappan seal was a square plaque 2Ã—2 square
inches, usually made from the soft river stone, steatite.
Every seal is engraved in a pictographic script which is
yet to be deciphered. Some seals have also been found in
gold and ivory. They all bear a great variety of motifs, most
often of animals including those of the bull, with or without
