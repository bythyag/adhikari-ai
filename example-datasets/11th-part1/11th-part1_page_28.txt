of jewellery found at Mohenjodaro and Lothal include
necklaces of gold and semi-precious stones, copper
bracelets and beads, gold earrings and head ornaments,
faience pendants and buttons, and beads of steatite and
gemstones. All ornaments are well crafted. It may be noted
that a cemetery has been found at Farmana in Haryana
where dead bodies were buried with ornaments.
The bead industry seems to have been well developed
as evident from the factories discovered at Chanhudaro
and Lothal. Beads were made of cornelian, amethyst,
jasper, crystal, quartz, steatite, turquoise, lapis lazuli, etc.
Metals like copper, bronze and gold, and shell, faience and
terracotta or burnt clay were also used for manufacturing
beads. The beads are in varying shapesâ€”disc-shaped,
cylindrical, spherical, barrel-shaped, and segmented. Some
beads were made of two or more stones cemented together,
some of stone with gold covers. Some were decorated by
incising or painting and some had designs etched onto
them. Great technical skill has been displayed in the
manufacture of these beads.
The Harappan people also made brilliantly naturalistic
models of animals, especially monkeys and squirrels, used
as pin-heads and beads.

spindles and spindle whorls in the houses of the Indus
