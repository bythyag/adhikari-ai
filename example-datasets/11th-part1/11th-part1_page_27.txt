Pottery
A large quantity of pottery excavated from the sites, enable
us to understand the gradual evolution of various design
motifs as employed in different shapes, and styles. The
Indus Valley pottery consists chiefly of very fine wheel-
made wares, very few being hand-made. Plain pottery is
more common than painted ware. Plain pottery is generally
of red clay, with or without a fine red or grey slip. It includes
knobbed ware,  ornamented with rows of knobs. The black
painted ware has a fine coating of red slip on which
geometric and animal designs are executed in glossy black
paint.
Polychrome pottery is rare and mainly comprises small
vases decorated with geometric patterns in red, black, and
green, rarely white and yellow. Incised ware is also rare
and the incised decoration was confined to the bases of
the pans, always inside and to the dishes of offering stands.
Perforated pottery includes a large hole at the bottom and
small holes all over the wall, and was probably used for
straining liquor. Pottery for household purposes is found
in as many shapes and sizes as could be conceived of for
daily practical use. Straight and angular shapes are an
exception, while graceful curves are the rule. Miniature
vessels, mostly less than half an inch in height are,
particularly, so marvellously crafted as to evoke admiration.

The Harappan men and women decorated themselves with
a large variety of ornaments produced from every
conceivable material ranging from precious metals and
gemstones to bone and baked clay. While necklaces, fillets,
armlets and finger-rings were commonly worn by both
