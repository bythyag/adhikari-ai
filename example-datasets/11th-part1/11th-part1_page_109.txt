TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE

bronzes were often subsequently inlaid with silver and
copper to bring out the eyes, crowns and details of the
textiles on which the figures were seated. Many famous
Jain bronzes from Chausa in Bihar are now kept in the
Patna Museum. Many Jain bronzes from Hansi in Haryana
and from various sites in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are
kept in various museums in India.
The Jain temples at Mount Abu were constructed by
Vimal Shah. Notable for a simplistic exterior in contrast
with the exuberant marble interiors, their rich sculptural
decoration with deep undercutting creates a lace-like
appearance. The temple is famous for its unique patterns
on every ceiling, and the graceful bracket figures along
the domed ceilings. The great Jain pilgrimage site in the
Shatrunjay hills near Palitana in Kathiawar, Gujarat, is
imposing with scores of temples clustered together.
In this chapter we have read about the prolific sculptural
and architectural remains in different types of stone,
terracotta and bronze from the fifth to the fourteenth
centuries. Undoubtedly there would have been sculptures
made of other media like silver and gold, but these would
have been melted down and reused. Many sculptures would
also have been made of wood and ivory, but these have
perished because of their fragility. Often sculptures would
have been painted, but again, pigments cannot always
survive hundreds of years, especially if the sculptures were
exposed to the elements. There was also a rich tradition of
painting at this time, but the only examples that survive
from this period are murals in a few religious buildings. A
