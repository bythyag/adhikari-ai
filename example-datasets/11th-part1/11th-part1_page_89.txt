TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE
75
West India
The temples in the north-western parts of India including
Gujarat and Rajasthan, and stylistically extendable, at
times, to western Madhya Pradesh are too numerous to
include here in any comprehensive way. The stone used to
build the temples ranges in colour and type. While
sandstone is the commonest, a grey to black basalt can be
seen in some of the tenth to twelveth century temple
sculptures. The most exuberant and famed is the
manipulatable soft white marble which is also seen in some
of the tenth to twelveth century Jain temples in Mount
Abu and the fifteenth century temple at Ranakpur.
Among the most important art-historical sites
in the region is Samlaji in Gujarat which shows
how earlier artistic traditions of the region mixed
with a post-Gupta style and gave rise to a distinct
style of sculpture. A large number of sculptures
made of grey schist have been found in this region
which can be dated between the sixth and eighth
centuries CE. While the patronage of these is
debated, the date is established on the basis of
the style.
The Sun temple at Modhera dates back to early
eleventh century and was built by Raja Bhimdev I
of the Solanki Dynasty in 1026. The Solankis were
a branch of the later Chalukyas. There is a
massive rectangular stepped tank called the surya
kund in front of it. Proximity of sacred architecture
to a water body such as a tank, a river or a pond
has been noticed right from the earliest times.
By the early eleventh century they had become a
