SOME ASPECTS OF INDO-ISLAMIC ARCHITECTURE
The city of Mandu is located sixty miles from Indore, at an elevation of over 2000
feet and overlooks the Malwa Plateau to the north and the Narmada valley to the
south. Mandu’s natural defence encouraged consistent habitations by Parmara
Rajputs, Afghans and Mughals. As the capital city of Ghauri Dynasty (1401–1561)
founded by Hoshang Shah it acquired a lot of fame. Subsequently, Mandu was
associated with the romance of Sultan Baz Bahadur and Rani Rupmati. The
Mughals resorted to it for pleasure during the monsoon season.
Mandu is a typical respresentation of the medieval provincial style of art and
architecture. It was a complex mix of official and residential-cum-pleasure palace,
pavilions, mosques, artificial reservoirs, baolis, embattlements, etc. In spite of the
size or monumentality, the structures were very close to nature, designed in the
style of arched pavilions, light and airy, so that these buildings did not retain
heat. Local stone and marble were used to great advantage. Mandu is a fine example
of architectural adaptation to the environment.
The Royal Enclave located in the city comprised the most complete and romantic
set of  buildings, a cluster of palaces and attendant
structures, official and residential, built around two
artificial lakes. The Hindola Mahal looks like a
railway viaduct bridge with its disproportionately
large buttresses supporting the walls. This was the
audience hall of the Sultan and also the place where
he showed himself to his subjects. Batter was used
very effectively to give an impression of swinging
(Hindola) walls.
Jahaaz Mahal is an elegant two-storey ‘ship-
palace’ between two reservoirs, with open pavilions,
balconies overhanging the water and a terrace.
Built by Sultan Ghiyasuddin Khilji it was possibly
used as his harem and as the ultimate pleasure
and recreational resort. It had a complex
