The trend continues in the fourth century CE but in the
late fourth century CE, the massiveness and fleshiness is
reduced further and the flesh becomes more tightened,
the volume of the drapery also gets reduced and in the
fifth and sixth centuries CE, the drapery is integrated into
the sculptural mass. Transparent quality in the robes of
the Buddha images is evident. In this period, two important
schools of sculptures in northern India are worth noting.
The traditional centre, Mathura, remained the main art
production site whereas Sarnath and Kosambi also emerged
as important centres of art production. Many Buddha
images in Sarnath have plain transparent drapery covering
both shoulders, and the halo around the head has very
little ornamentation whereas the Mathura Buddha images
continue to depict folds of the drapery in the Buddha images
and the halo around the head is profusely decorated. One
can visit museums at Mathura, Sarnath, Varanasi, New
Delhi, Chennai, Amaravati, etc. to study the features of
early sculptures.
