LATER MURAL TRADITIONS

elongation of the physiognomic features of human figuresâ€” 
all these represent the perfection the Chola artist had 
achieved during the period on the one hand and the phase 
of transition on the other. With the decline of power of the 
Chola dynasty in the thirteenth century, the Vijayanagara 
Dynasty captured and brought under its control the region 
from Hampi to Trichy with Hampi serving as its capital. 
Many paintings survive in a number of temples. The 
paintings at Tiruparakunram, near Trichy, done in the 
fourteenth century represent the early phase of the 
Vijayanagara style. In Hampi, the Virupaksha temple has 
paintings on the ceiling of its mandapa narrating events 
from dynastic history and episodes from the Ramayana 
and the Mahabharata. Among the important panels are the 
ones which show Vidyaranya, the spiritual teacher of 
Bukkaraya Harsha, being carried in a palanquin in a 
procession and the incarnations of Vishnu. The faces of 
the figures are shown in profile, with large frontal eyes. 
The figures have narrow waists. 
In Lepakshi, near Hindupur, in present Andhra Pradesh, 
there are glorious examples of Vijayanagara paintings on 
the walls of the Shiva temple. 
In keeping with the tradition, the Vijayanagara painters 
evolved a pictorial language wherein the faces are shown 
in profile and figures and objects two-dimensionally. Lines 
become still but fluid, compositions appear in rectilinear 
compartments. These stylistic conventions of the preceding 
centuries were adopted by artists in various centres in 
South India as can be seen in the paintings of the Nayaka 
Period. 
Nayaka paintings of the seventeenth and eigtheenth 
centuries are seen in Thiruparakunram, Sreerangam and
