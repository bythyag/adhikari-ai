AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN ART

enclosed within the complex. Subsidiary shrines are either
incorporated within the main temple tower, or located as
distinct, separate small shrines beside the main temple.
The North Indian idea of multiple shikharas rising together
as a cluster was not popular in South India. At some of
the most sacred temples in South India, the main temple
in which the garbhagriha is situated has, in fact, one of
the smallest towers. This is because it is usually the oldest
part of the temple. With the passage of time, the population
and size of the town associated with that temple would
have increased, and it would have become necessary to
make a new boundary wall around the temple. This would
have been taller that the last one, and its gopurams would
have been even loftier. So, for instance, the Srirangam
temple in Tiruchirapally has as many as seven ‘concentric’
rectangular enclosure walls, each with gopurams. The
outermost is the newest, while the tower right in the centre
housing the garbhagriha is the oldest.
Temples thus started becoming the focus of urban
architecture. Kanchipuram, Thanjavur or Tanjore, Madurai
and Kumbakonam are the most famous temple towns of
Tamil Nadu, where, during the eighth to twelfth  centuries,
the role of the temple was not limited to religious matters
alone. Temples became rich administrative centres,
controlling vast areas of land.
Just as there are many subdivisions of the main types
of nagara temples, there are subdivisions also of dravida
temples. These are basically of five different shapes: square,
usually called kuta, and also caturasra; rectangular or shala
or ayatasra; elliptical, called gaja-prishta or elephant-
backed, or also called vrittayata, deriving from wagon-
