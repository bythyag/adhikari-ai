century, when the Cholas reached their zenith of power, 
that masterpieces of Chola art and architecture began to 
appear. The temples of Brihadeswara at Thanjavur, 
Gangaikonda Cholapuram and Darasuram were built 
during the reigns of Rajaraja Chola and his son, Rajendra 
Chola. 
Though Chola paintings are seen in Nartamalai, the 
most important are those in Brihadeswara temple. The 
paintings were executed on the walls of the narrow passage 
surrounding the shrine. Two layers of paint were found 
when they were discovered. The upper layer was painted 
during the Nayak period, in the sixteenth century. Thanks 
to the cleaning of the surface painting, examples of the 
great tradition of painting during the Chola Period were 
unveiled. The paintings show narrations and aspects 
related to Lord Shiva, Shiva in Kailash, Shiva as
