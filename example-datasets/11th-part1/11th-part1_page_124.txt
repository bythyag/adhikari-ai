AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN ART

TYPOLOGIES OF STRUCTURES
Keeping in mind religious and secular necessities, architectural
building like mosques for daily prayers, the Jama Masjids, tombs,
dargahs, minars, hammams, formally laid out gardens, madrasas,
sarais or caravansarais, Kos minars, etc., were constructed over
a period of time. These were thus additions in the existing types
of buildings in the sub-continent.
Architectural edifices in the Indian sub-continent, as elsewhere
in the world, were constructed by wealthy people.  They were, in
descending order, rulers and nobles and their families, merchants,
merchant guilds, rural elite and devotees of a cult. In spite of the
obvious Saracenic, Persian and Turkish influences, Indo-Islamic
structures were heavily influenced by prevailing sensibilities of
Indian architectural and decorative forms. A lot depended on the
availability of materials, limitations of resources and skills and
the sense of aesthetics of the patrons. Although religion and
religiosity were very important to people of medieval India, as
elsewhere, they borrowed architectural elements liberally.
CATEGORIES OF STYLES
The study of Indo-Islamic architecture is conventionally
categorised into the Imperial Style (Delhi Sultanate), the Provincial
Style (Mandu, Gujarat, Bengal, and Jaunpur), the Mughal Style
(Delhi, Agra, and Lahore) and the Deccani Style (Bijapur,
Golconda). These categories help in understanding better the
specificities of architectural styles rather than putting them in
immutable slots.
