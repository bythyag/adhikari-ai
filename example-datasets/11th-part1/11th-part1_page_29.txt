ARTS OF THE INDUS VALLEY
15
Valley that spinning of cotton and wool was very common.
The fact that both the rich and the poor practised spinning
is indicated by finds of whorls made of the expensive faience
as also of the cheap pottery and shell. Men and women
wore two separate pieces of attire similar to the dhoti and
shawl. The shawl covered the left shoulder passing below
the right shoulder.
From archaeological finds it appears that the people of
the Indus Valley were conscious of fashion. Different
hairstyles were in vogue and wearing of a beard was popular
among all. Cinnabar was used as a cosmetic and face-
paint, lipstick and collyrium (eyeliner) were also known to
them. Many stone structural remains are also found at
Dholavira which show how the Indus Valley people used
stone in construction.
The artists and craftsmen of the Indus Valley were
extremely skilled in a variety of craftsâ€”metal casting, stone
carving, making and painting pottery and making terracotta
images using simplified motifs of animals, plants and birds.
