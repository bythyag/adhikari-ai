AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN ART

is surrounded by a veranda of a later kind, with a shikhara
that is stylistically like a nagara one. Finally, mention
must be made of the Lad Khan temple at Aihole. This seems
to be inspired by the wooden-roofed temples of the hills,
except that it is constructed out of stone.
How then shall we understand these different styles at
one place? As curiosities or as innovations? Undoubtedly,
they are dynamic expressions of a creative set of architects
who were competing with their peers in the rest of India.
Whatever oneâ€™s explanation is, these buildings remain of
great art-historical interest.
With the waning of Chola and Pandya power, the
Hoysalas of Karnataka grew to prominence in South India
and became the most important patrons centred at Mysore.
The remains of around hundred temples have been found
in southern Deccan, though it is only three of them that
are most frequently discussed: the temples at Belur,
Halebid and Somnathpuram. Perhaps the
most characteristic feature of these temples
is that they grow extremely complex with so
many projecting angles emerging from the
previously straightforward square temple,
that the plan of these temples starts looking
like a star, and is thus known as a stellate-
plan. Since they are made out of soapstone
which is a relatively soft stone, the artists
were able to carve their sculptures
intricately. This can be seen particularly in
the jewellery of the gods that adorn their
temple walls.
