TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE
87
Pulakesin I established the early western Chalukya
kingdom when he secured the land around Badami in 543.
The early western Chalukyas ruled most of the Deccan till
the mid-eighth century when they were superseded by the
Rashtrakutas. Early Chalukyan activity also takes the
form of rock-cut caves while later activity is of structural
temples. The earliest is probably the Ravana Phadi cave
at Aihole which is known for its distinctive sculptural style.
One of the most important sculptures at the site is of
Nataraja, surrounded by larger-than-life-size depictions
of the saptamatrikas: three to Shivaâ€™s left and four to his
right. The figures are characterised by graceful, slim bodies,
long, oval faces topped with extremely tall cylindrical
crowns and shown to wear short dhotis marked by fine
incised striations indicating pleating. They are distinctly
different from contemporary western Deccan or Vakataka
styles seen at places such as Paunar and Ramtek.
The hybridisation and incorporation of several styles
was the hallmark of Chalukyan buildings. The most
elaborate of all Chalukyan temples at Pattadakal made in
the reign of Vikramaditya II (733-44) by his chief queen
Loka Mahadevi, for instance, shows complete knowledge
of Pallava buildings at Kanchipuram and as a corollary,
Mahabalipuram. The temple is one of the best early
examples of the dravida tradition. By contrast other eastern
Chalukyan temples, like the Mahakuta, five kilometres
from Badami, and the Swarga Brahma temple at Alampur
show a greater assimilation of northern styles from Odisha
and Rajasthan. At the same time the Durga temple at
Aihole is unique having an even earlier style of an apsidal
shrine which is reminiscent of Buddhist chaitya halls and
