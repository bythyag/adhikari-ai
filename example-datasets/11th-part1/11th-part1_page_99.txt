TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE
85
Chola period are in a good state of preservation, and many
more are still active shrines.  Bigger in scale than anything
built by their predecessors, the Pallavas, Chalukyas or
Pandyas, this Chola templeâ€™s pyramidal multi-storeyed
vimana rises a massive seventy metres (approximately two
hundred feet), topped by a monolithic shikhara which is
an octagonal dome-shaped stupika. It is in this temple that
one notices for the first time two large gopuras (gateway
towers) with an elaborate sculptural programme which
was conceived along with the temple. Huge Nandi-figures
dot the corners of the shikhara, and the kalasha on top by
itself is about three metres and eight centimetres in height.
Hundreds of stucco figures decorate the vimana, although
it is possible that some of these may have been added on
during the Maratha Period and did not always belong to
the Chola Period. The main deity of the temple is Shiva,
who is shown as a huge lingam set in a two storeyed
sanctum. The walls surrounding the sanctum have extended
mythological narratives which are depicted through painted
murals and sculptures.
Architecture in the Deccan
Many different styles of temple architecture influenced by
both North and South Indian temples were used in regions
like Karnataka. While some scholars consider the buildings
in this region as being distinctly  either nagara or dravida,
a hybridised style that seems to have become popular after
the mid-seventh century, is known in some ancient texts
as vesara.
By the late seventh or the early eighth century, the
ambitious projects at Ellora became even grander. By about
750 CE, the early western Chalukya control of the Deccan
was taken by the Rashtrakutas. Their greatest achievement
in architecture is the Kailashnath temple at Ellora,
