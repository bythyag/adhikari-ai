AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN ART
120
Taj Mahal was built in Agra by Shah Jahan as
a mausoleum for his deceased wife Mumtaz
Mahal. Taj Mahal was the apogee of the
evolutionary architectural process in medieval
India.
The sublimity of the building comes from
its orderly, simple plan and elevation,
amazingly perfect proportions or symmetry, the
ethereal quality marble has lent to it, the
perfect setting of bagh and river and the pure
outline of the tomb silhouetted against the sky.
The patina the Taj has lends it a different hue
at various times of day and night.
The Taj complex is entered through a
monumental red sandstone gateway the
opening arch of which beautifully frames the
mausoleum. The tomb is laid out in a Chahar
Bagh, criss-crossed with paths and water
courses, interspersed with pools and fountains.
The structure is placed on the northern
extremity of the bagh instead of the middle to
take advantage of the river bank.
