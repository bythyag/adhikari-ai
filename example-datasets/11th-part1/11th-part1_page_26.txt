AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN ART

the hump, the elephant, tiger, goat and also
monsters. Sometimes trees or human figures
were also depicted. The most remarkable seal
is the one depicted with a figure in the centre
and animals around. This seal is generally
identified as the Pashupati Seal by some
scholars whereas some identify it as the female
deity. This seal depicts a human figure seated
cross-legged. An elephant and a tiger are
depicted to the right side of the seated figure,
while on the left a rhinoceros and a buffalo
are seen. In addition to these animals two
antelopes are shown below the seat. Seals
such as these date from between 2500 and
1500 BCE and were found in considerable
numbers in sites such as the ancient city of
Mohenjodaro in the Indus Valley. Figures and
animals are carved in intaglio on their
surfaces.
Square or rectangular copper tablets, with
an animal or a human figure on one side and
an inscription on the other, or an inscription
on both sides have also been found. The figures
and signs are carefully cut with a burin. These
copper tablets appear to have been amulets.
Unlike inscriptions on seals which vary in each
case, inscriptions on the copper tablets seem
to be associated with the animals portrayed
on them.
