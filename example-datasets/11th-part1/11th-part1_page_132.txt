AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN ART

arrangement of watercourses and a terrace
swimming pool.
Rani Rupmati’s double pavilion
perched on the southern embattlements
afforded a beautiful view of the Narmada
valley. Baz Bahadur’s palace had a wide
courtyard ringed with halls and terraces.
A madrasa called Asharfi Mahal now
lies in ruins. Hoshang Shah’s tomb is a
majestic structure with a beautiful dome,
marble jali work, porticos, courts and
towers. It is regarded as an example of
the robustness of Afghan structures, but
its lattice work, carved brackets and
toranas lend it a softer hue.
The Jama Masjid of Mandu was built on a large scale to accommodate
many worshippers for Friday prayers. It is entered through a  monumental
gateway, topped with a squat dome, beyond which lies an open courtyard
flanked with columned cloisters on three sides, also topped with smaller
domes. The building is faced with red sandstone. The mimbar in the Qibla
Liwan is supported on carved brackets and the mihrab has a lotus bud
fringe.
Pathan architecture of Mandu is regarded as too close to the structures
of Imperial Delhi to make a bold statement of local traditions. Nevertheless,
the so-called robust, austere Pathan architecture of Mandu with its surface
embellishments of jalis, carved brackets, etc., and the lightness of the
structures was an important intervention in the narrative of the Indo-Islamic
architectural experience.
