AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN ART
86
a culmination of at least a millennium-long tradition in
rock-cut architecture in India. It is a complete dravida
building with a Nandi shrine—since the temple is dedicated
to Shiva—a gopuram-like gateway, surrounding cloisters,
subsidiary shrines, staircases and an imposing tower or
vimana rising to thirty metres. Importantly, all of this is
carved out of living rock. One portion of the monolithic
hill was carved patiently to build the Kailashnath temple.
The sculpture of the Rashtrakuta phase at Ellora is
dynamic, the figures often larger than life-size, infused
with unparalleled grandeur and the most overwhelming energy.
In the southern part of the Deccan, i.e., in the region
of Karnataka is where some of the most experimental
hybrid styles of vesara architecture are to be found.
