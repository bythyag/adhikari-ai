AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN ART

The edge of this vaulted chamber is rounded, like the
bamboo or wooden wagons that would have been drawn by
bullocks in ancient times. They are usually called ‘wagon-
vaulted buildings’. As mentioned above, the form of the
temple is influenced by ancient building forms that were
already in existence before the fifth century CE. The valabhi
type of building was one of them. For instance, if you study
the ground-plan of many of the Buddhist rock-cut chaitya
caves, you will notice that they are shaped as long halls
which end in a curved back. From the inside, the roof of
this portion also looks like a wagon-vaulted roof.

Ancient temples of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and
Rajasthan share many traits. The most visible is that they
are made of sandstone. Some of the oldest surviving
structural temples from the Gupta Period are in Madhya
Pradesh. These are relatively modest-looking shrines each
having four pillars that support a small mandapa which
looks like a simple square porch-like extension before an
equally small room that served as the garbhagriha.
Importantly, of the two such temples that survive, one is
at Udaigiri, which is on the outskirts of Vidisha and is
part of a larger Hindu complex of cave shrines, while the
other one is at Sanchi, which was a Buddhist site. This
means that similar developments were being incorporated
in the architecture of temples of both the religions.
The patrons and donors of the temple at Deogarh (in
Lalitpur District, Uttar Pradesh) are unknown; however
on the basis of both architecture and imagery, it is
