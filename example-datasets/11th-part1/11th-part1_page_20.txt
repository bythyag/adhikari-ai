DANCING SCENE
Hunting scenes predominate in Mesolithic paintings. This is one such scene
where a group of people are shown hunting a bison. Some injured men are
depicted lying scattered on the ground.  These paintings show mastery in the
skill of drawing these forms.
In this picture hand-linked figures in dancing mode are shown. In fact, this is a
recurrent theme. It also recalls the dancing scene from the Lakhudiyar rock
painting found in Uttarakhand.
