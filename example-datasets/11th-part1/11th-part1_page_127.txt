of outer walls as in Golconda, so that the enemy had to breach

Daulatabad had several strategic devices to confound the
enemy, such as staggered entrances so that gates could not be
opened even with the help of elephants. It also had twin forts,
one within the other but at a higher elevation and accessed by a
complex defence design arrangement. One wrong turn in the
labyrinth or complex pathway could lead to the enemy soldier
going in circles or falling to his death several hundred feet below.
The Gwalior Fort was invincible because its steep height made
it impossible to scale. It had had many habitations and usages.
Babur, who did not find much merit in many things he saw in
Hindustan, was said to have been overawed at the sight of the
Gwalior Fort. Chittorgarh bears the distinction of being the largest
fort in Asia and was occupied for the longest length of time as
the seat of power. It has many types of buildings including
stambhas or towers to signify victory and bravery. It was replete
with numerous water bodies. Innumerable acts of heroism have
been associated with the principal people in the fort, forming the
substance of many a legend. An interesting aspect associated
with forts is that within the palace complexes stylistic and
decorative influences were absorbed most liberally.
MINARS
Another form of stambha or tower was the minar, a common feature
in the sub-continent. Two most striking minars of medieval times
are the Qutub Minar in Delhi and the Chand Minar at Daulatabad
