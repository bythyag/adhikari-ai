Amaravati Stupa also has pradakshinapatha enclosed

stupa sculptural slabs which is a unique feature. The torana
of the Amaravati Stupa has disappeared over a period of
time. Events from the life of the Buddha and the Jataka
stories are depicted. Though in the Amaravati Stupa there
is  evidence of construction activity in the third century
BCE, it was best developed in the first and second centuries
CE. Like Sanchi, the early phase is devoid of Buddha images
but during the later phase, in the second and third
centuries CE, the Buddha images are carved on the drum
slabs and at many other places. Interior space in the
composition is created by different postures of the figures
such as semi-back, back, profile, frontal, semi-frontal,
side, etc.
Sculptural form in this area is characterised by intense
emotions. Figures are slender, have a lot of movement,
bodies are shown with three bents (i.e. tribhanga), and the
sculptural composition is more complex than at Sanchi.
Linearity becomes flexible, dynamic movement breaks the
staticness of form. The idea of creating three-dimensional
space in the relief sculpture is devised by using pronounced
volume, angular bodies and complex overlapping. However,
