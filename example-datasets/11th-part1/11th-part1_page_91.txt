TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE
77
Terracotta temple, Vishnupur
from Rangagora Tea Estate near Tinsukia in Assam bear
witness to the import of the Gupta idiom in that region.
This post-Gupta style continued in the region well into
the tenth century. However, by the twelfth to fourteenth
centuries, a distinct regional style developed in Assam.
The style that came with the migration of the Tais from
Upper Burma mixed with the dominant Pala style of Bengal
and led to the creation of what was later known as the
Ahom style in and around Guwahati. Kamakhya temple, a
Shakti Peeth, is dedicated to Goddess Kamakhya and was
built in the seventeenth century.
Bengal: The style of the sculptures during the period
between the ninth and eleventh centuries in Bengal
(including Bangladesh) and Bihar is known as the Pala
style, named after the ruling dynasty at the time, while
the style of those of the mid-eleventh to mid-thirteenth
centuries is named after the Sena kings. While the Palas
are celebrated as patrons of many Buddhist monastic sites,
the temples from that region are known to express the
local Vanga style. The ninth century Siddheshvara
Mahadeva temple in Barakar in Burdwan District, for
example, shows a tall curving shikhara crowned by a large
amalaka and is an example of the early Pala style. It is
similar to contemporaneous temples of Odisha. This basic
form grows loftier with the passing of centuries. Many of
the temples from the ninth to the twelfth century were
located at Telkupi in Purulia District. They were submerged
when dams were built in the region. These were amongst
the important examples of architectural styles prevalent
