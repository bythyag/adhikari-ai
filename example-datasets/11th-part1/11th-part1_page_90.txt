AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN ART

part of many temples. This hundred-square-metre
rectangular pond is perhaps the grandest temple tank in
India. A hundred and eight miniature shrines are carved
in between the steps inside the tank. A huge ornamental
arch-torana leads one to the sabha mandapa (the assembly
hall) which is open on all sides, as was the fashion of the
times in western and central Indian temples.
The influence of the woodcarving tradition of Gujarat is
evident in the lavish carving and sculpture work. However,
the walls of the central small shrine are devoid of carving
and are left plain as the temple faces the east and, every
year, at the time of the equinoxes, the sun shines directly
into this central shrine.
East India
Eastern Indian temples include those found in the North-
East, Bengal and Odisha. Each of these three areas
produced distinct types of temples. The history of
architecture in the North-East and Bengal is hard to study
because a number of ancient buildings in those regions
were renovated, and what survives now are later brick or
concrete temples at those sites. It appears that terracotta
was the main medium of construction, and also for
moulding plaques which depicted Buddhist and Hindu
deities in Bengal until the seventh century. A large number
of sculptures have been found in Assam and Bengal which
shows the development of important regional schools in
those regions.
