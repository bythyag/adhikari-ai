Gandhiji’s Talisman
I will give you a talisman. Whenever
you are in doubt or when the self
becomes too much with you, apply the
following test:
Recall the face of the poorest and
the weakest man whom you may have
seen and ask yourself if the step you
contemplate is going to be of any use
to him. Will he gain anything by it?
Will it restore him to a control over
his own life and destiny? In other
words, will it lead to Swaraj for the
hungry and spiritually starving
millions?
Then you will find your doubts and
your self melting away.
