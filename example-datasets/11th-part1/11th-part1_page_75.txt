VEN after Ajanta, very few sites with paintings have 
survived which provide valuable evidences to 
reconstruct the tradition of paintings. It may also be noted 
that the sculptures too were plastered and painted. The 
tradition of cave excavations continued further at many 
places where sculpting and painting were done 
simultaneously. 
Badami 
One such site is Badami in the State of Karnataka. Badami 
was the capital of the western Chalukyan dynasty which 
ruled the region from 543 to 598 CE. With 
the decline of the Vakataka rule, the 
Chalukyas established their power in the 
Deccan. The Chalukya king, Mangalesha, 
patronised the excavation of the Badami 
caves. He was the younger son of the 
Chalukya king, Pulakesi I, and the brother 
of Kirtivarman I. The inscription in Cave No.4 
mentions the date 578â€“579 CE, describes the 
beauty of the cave and includes the dedication 
of the image of Vishnu. Thus it may be 
presumed that the cave was excavated in the 
same era and the patron records his 
Vaishnava affiliation. Therefore, the cave is 
popularly known as the Vishnu Cave. Only a 
fragment of the painting has survived on the 
vaulted roof of the front mandapa. 
Paintings in this cave depict palace 
scenes. One shows Kirtivarman, the son of 
Pulakesi I and the elder brother of 
Mangalesha, seated inside the palace with 
his wife and feudatories watching a dance 
scene. Towards the corner of the panel are 
figures of Indra and his retinue. Stylistically 
speaking, the painting represents an
