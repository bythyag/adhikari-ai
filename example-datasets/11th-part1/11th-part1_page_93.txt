TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE
79
ground plan of the main temple is almost always square,
which, in the upper reaches of its superstructure becomes
circular in the crowning mastaka. This makes the spire
nearly cylindrical in appearance in its length.
Compartments and niches are generally square, the
exterior of the temples are lavishly carved, their interiors
generally quite bare. Odisha temples usually have
boundary walls.
At Konark, on the shores of the Bay of Bengal, lie the
majestic ruins of the Surya or Sun temple built in stone
around 1240. Its shikhara was a colossal creation said to
have reached 70m, which, proving too heavy for its site,
fell in the nineteenth century. The vast complex is within
a quadrilateral precinct of which the jagamohana or the
dance-pavillion (mandapa) has survived, which though no
longer accessible is said to be the largest enclosed space
in Hindu architecture.
The Sun temple is set on a high base, its walls covered
in extensive, detailed ornamental carving. These include
twelve pairs of enormous wheels sculpted with spokes and
hubs, representing the chariot wheels of the Sun god who,
in mythology, rides a chariot driven by eight horses,
sculpted here at the entrance staircase. The whole temple
thus comes to resemble a colossal processional chariot.
