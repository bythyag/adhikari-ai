POST-MAURYAN TRENDS IN INDIAN ART AND ARCHITECTURE

paintings such as Simhala Avadana, Mahajanaka Jataka
and Vidhurpundita Jataka cover the entire wall of the cave.
It is worth noting that Chaddanta Jataka has been painted
in the early Cave No. 10 with many details and events
grouped according to their geographical locations. Events
that happened in the jungle and events that happened in
the palace are separated by their locations. In Cave No. 10
Chaddanta faithfully follows the Pali text whereas the one
painted in Cave No. 17 is very different. In one of the events,
the Boddhisattva, Chaddanta, is shown removing his own
tusk and giving it to the hunter, Sonuttar. The other
important paintings are the famous Padmapani and
Vajrapani in Cave No. 1. However, it may be observed that
the images of Padmapani and Vajrapani are very common
in Ajanta but the best preserved paintings are in Cave No.
1. Some figures in Cave No. 2 have affiliation with the
Vengi sculptures and at the same time, the influence of
the Vidarbha sculptural tradition is also observed in the
delineation of some sculptures. The subsequent
development of the painting tradition has been discussed
in the next chapter.
Ellora
Another important cave site located in Aurangabad District
is Ellora. It is located a hundred kilometres from Ajanta
and has thirty-two Buddhist, Brahmanical and Jain caves.
It is a unique art-historical site in the country as it has
monastries associated with the three religions dating from
the fifth century CE onwards to the eleventh century CE.
