Pradesh and Bihar, during the Gupta and Post-Gupta
periods, i.e., between the fifth, sixth and seventh centuries.
The sanghati or the monk’s robe is wrapped to cover the
shoulders which turns over the right arm, while the other
end of the drapery is wrapped over the left arm. Eventually
the pleats are held by the extended hand of the same arm.
The drapery falls and spreads into a wide curve at the
level of the ankles. The Buddha’s figure is modelled in a
subtle manner suggesting, at the same time, the thin
quality of the cloth. The whole figure is treated with
refinement; there is a certain delicacy in the treatment of
the torso. The figure appears youthful and proportionate
in comparison with the Kushana style. In the typical bronze
from Dhanesar Khera, Uttar Pradesh, the folds of the
drapery are treated as in the Mathura style, i.e., in a series
of drooping down curves. Sarnath-style bronzes have
foldless drapery. The outstanding example is that of the
Buddha image at Sultanganj, Bihar, which is quite a
monumental bronze figure. The typical refined style of
these bronzes is the hallmark of the classical quality.
Vakataka bronze images of the Buddha from Phophnar,
Maharashtra, are contemporary with the Gupta period
bronzes. They show the influence of the Amaravati style of
Andhra Pradesh in the third century CE and at the same
time there is a significant change in the draping style of
the monk’s robe. Buddha’s right hand in abhaya mudra is
free so that the drapery clings to the right side of the body
