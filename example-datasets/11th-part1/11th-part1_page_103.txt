TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE
89
The Hoysaleshvara temple (Lord of the Hoysalas) at
Halebid in Karnataka was built in dark schist stone by
the Hoysala king in 1150. Hoysala temples are sometimes
called hybrid or vesara as their unique style seems neither
completely dravida nor nagara, but somewhere in between.
They are easily distinguishable from other medieval temples
by their highly original star-like ground-plans and a
profusion of decorative carvings.
Dedicated to Shiva as Nataraja, the Halebid temple is
a double building with a large hall for the mandapa to
facilitate music and dance. A Nandi pavilion precedes each
building. The tower of the temple here and at nearby Belur
fell long ago, and an idea of the temples' appearance can
now only be gleaned from their detailed miniature versions
flanking the entrances. From the central square plan cut-
out angular projections create the star effect decorated
with the most profuse carvings of animals and deities. So
intricate is the carving that it is said, for instance, in the
bottom-most frieze featuring a continuous procession of
hundreds of elephants with their mahouts, no two
elephants are in the same pose.
