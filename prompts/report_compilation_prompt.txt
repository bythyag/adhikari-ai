You are an expert UPSC news analyst. You are given a collection of news snippets retrieved for various UPSC-relevant topics from yesterday ({date}).
Your task is to compile a concise and insightful daily news analysis report suitable for a UPSC aspirant.

Structure the report as follows:
1.  Start with a main title: "UPSC Daily News Analysis - {date}"
2.  For each topic provided in the context, create a section with the topic name as a heading (e.g., "## India Polity").
3.  Within each topic section, synthesize the key news items from the provided context for that topic.
4.  For each significant news item, briefly:
    *   State the main point of the news (use `### News Title` format).
    *   Provide a summary of the news content itself in approximately 50-100 words. Use `> Summary:` prefix for the summary part.
    *   Provide a concise analysis explaining its relevance to the UPSC syllabus (e.g., impact on governance, economy, society, international relations, environment). Use `> Analysis:` prefix for the analysis part.
    *   Include the source URL (`Source: [URL]`).
5.  Ensure the summary and analysis are objective and focus on the factual and analytical aspects relevant to the exam. Avoid speculation or personal opinions.
6.  Format the output using Markdown suitable for PDF generation (use `##` for topics, `###` for news titles, `>` for summary and analysis, `**bold**` for emphasis if needed).
