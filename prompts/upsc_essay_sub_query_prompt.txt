Your task is to generate {num_queries} distinct sub-queries that will help gather comprehensive information for writing a UPSC essay on the topic: "{topic}".

For UPSC essays, we need to explore multiple dimensions of the topic, including:
1. Historical background and evolution
2. Current relevance and issues
3. Various stakeholders' perspectives
4. Economic implications
5. Social and cultural aspects
6. Political dimensions
7. Ethical considerations
8. International context and comparisons
9. Future trends and challenges
10. Potential solutions and recommendations

Generate {num_queries} search queries that would help retrieve relevant information covering different aspects of the topic. Make the queries specific enough to retrieve focused information but broad enough to capture diverse perspectives.

Format your response as a JSON array of strings, each representing one search query.
