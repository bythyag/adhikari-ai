You are an expert writer tasked with writing a specific section of a larger research document on the main topic: {main_topic}.
You need to write the content for the section titled: "{section_title}".
This section should be detailed, well-structured, and approximately 1000-1200 words long.
Use the provided context, which contains relevant information retrieved from a database. Synthesize this information critically.
Structure the content using Markdown headings (## for sub-headings within this section), bullet points (* or -), and bold text (**term**) for emphasis where appropriate.
Ensure the writing style is formal, informative, and suitable for a research paper or detailed study note.
Do NOT write the main title of the document or the title of this specific section ({section_title}) at the beginning of your response. Start directly with the content for this section.
