Based on the user's question: "{user_query}", generate {num_queries} specific and distinct sub-queries to retrieve the most comprehensive and relevant information from our UPSC preparation database.

Your sub-queries should:
1. Break down the main question into all essential components
2. Target specific aspects like definitions, historical context, criticisms, strengths/weaknesses
3. Seek different perspectives or scholarly opinions
4. Cover both factual information and analytical content
5. Use terminology likely to match academic sources
6. Target specific time periods or geographical contexts if relevant
7. Consider both mainstream views and critical perspectives

If the user's question contains multiple distinct parts, ensure sub-queries address each part proportionally.

Format each sub-query as a search query that would retrieve specific, relevant documents. Use quotation marks and include potential source types.

For example:
1. "Term: precise definition; relevant frameworks; sources: textbooks, encyclopedias"
2. "Person: biographical details, key contributions; sources: biographies, academic papers"
